# Continuous integration

GitHub Actions is the source of truth for merge safety. It checks every change,
scans dependencies and secrets, and publishes the demo and release artifacts.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Runs on | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ci` | pushes to `main`/`dev`, pull requests | Installs with the frozen lockfile and runs `scripts/verify-production-ready.sh`: tooling tests, a batched public-tree scan, architecture checks, and fresh package builds. The `web` and `containers` jobs must also pass before merge. |
| `dependency-review` | pull requests | Scans `pnpm-lock.yaml` with OSV. |
| `gitleaks` | pull requests, pushes to `main`/`dev` | Scans for committed secrets. |
| `codeql` | pull requests, pushes to `main`/`dev`, weekly | Runs CodeQL analysis. |
| `pages` | pushes to `main`, manual dispatch | Builds the fixture-only static demo and its design preview, then deploys the verified artifact. |
| `release` | `v*` tags | Checks metadata and the source gate, verifies the `apps/api` image, pushes it to GHCR, and creates the GitHub Release. |

The release workflow runs its image and release jobs separately, so publication
is not atomic. After a failed run, check GHCR and GitHub Releases independently.
Stable tags also move the `latest` tag; prerelease tags do not.

## Reproduce CI locally

~~~bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm verify
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
pnpm verify:web
pnpm verify:containers
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/repo" ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks:v8.28.0 detect --redact --source=/repo --config=/repo/.gitleaks.toml
~~~

`pnpm verify` mirrors the `ci` job; set `SKIP_INSTALL=1` when the frozen install
already ran.
`pnpm verify` is not a substitute for the remote checks: OSV, Gitleaks, CodeQL,
Docker publication, Pages deployment, EAS, and native accessibility checks all
happen outside it.

## Policy

Public pull-request workflows need no secrets. Keep privileged jobs on trusted
branches or manual dispatch, pin tools and actions, and install with the frozen
lockfile. `CODEOWNERS` protects the workflow, security, release, container,
contract, and institution-pack surfaces.

## Browser and container gates

`pnpm verify:web` exports the fixture-only demo, validates the artifact, exports
the normal client with an intercepted HTTPS fixture origin, then runs pinned
Playwright 1.63.0 Chromium scenarios against both. No campus service is
required. The scenarios cover navigation, responsive rendering, cache and
recovery behavior, and demo network isolation.

For day-to-day work, `pnpm test:web` runs against a prepared demo and the normal
development server, and `CONCOURSE_WEB_BUILD=production pnpm test:web` uses the
prepared normal export. `pnpm build:web:client` rebuilds the browser-test
artifact with the example institution pack and a cleared Metro cache. Playwright
intercepts the HTTPS fixture origin, so no deployed service is involved. Set
`CONCOURSE_WEB_RESULTS` to keep results, traces, and screenshots somewhere
useful; the default is `/tmp/concourse-playwright-results`.

`pnpm verify:containers` builds both API Dockerfiles and runs the shared image
smoke helper. It checks non-root execution, compiled output, shared and external
runtime dependencies, health and version on port 4107, invalid startup settings,
and request draining. The release workflow reuses the same helper before pushing
the image.

Branch protection should require the `ci`, `web`, and `containers` jobs. Workflow
files define those jobs; applying branch protection is a separate repository
administration step. Turbo archives use a revision-specific save key and
configuration/branch restore prefixes, so new results are saved per commit.
Changes to the shared cleanup helper invalidate package tasks.
